# Airship.app

I badly wanted an iPhone. Back in 2008 I bought an iPhone 3GS and proudly proclaimed to my girlfriend (now wife) that I was going to write apps!

The first app I ever wrote was a South African Income Tax calculator, it reached #1 of the free chart in the South African App Store. This was not a big deal, because it was only myself and Nico from Glucode who had "South African made" apps in the store.

Airship was my second iOS application. I think I sold 10,000 copies over it's lifetime. It also featured some code and features that made me want to go insane.

I recently found the code and I'm sharing it here.
